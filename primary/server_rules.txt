**== Our Community Guidelines ==**
In order to maintain a safe environmet for all our members, our guidelines are as follows:
- **1)** Maintain a polite attitude (being silly is fine, until it crosses into disrespect).
- **2)** Don't spam messages/pings (especially ```@everyone```, ```@member```, ```@ally```).
- **3)** Don't use mass pings (for example: ```@everyone```, ```@member```) UNLESS you have been given explicit permission from an officer or above, or it is absolutely necessary (it's recommended to get a First Officer to do this).
- **4)** Do not partake in any kind of harmful/illegal activities on our server. If you see such activities occuring, immediately inform a First Officer.
- **5)** Do not use the server in order to advertise services (like artwork)(this is due to a Discord exploit that could use this as a vector of attack).
- **6)** Do not leak/expose/distribute any White Star (WS) plans UNLESS your First Officer allows you.

**== Notice ==**
-# We reserve the right to take disciplinary action against any user at our discretion, within the bounds of fairness and morality
-# Doing things that break what are generally unspoken rules will not be tolerated, and "it wasn't in the rules channel" won't be taken as an excuse
-# We reserve the right to change/add/remove these Rules and Guidelines as we see fit, however you will be notified that the rules have changed. By that point, the rules are considered in effect unless otherwise stated.
***NOTE***: The rules and guidelines are currently a work in progress, so expect frequent changes. However, all of the above is considered as active rules unless removed before we fully set them as "active". Any violations will be treated according to their severity.
We will inform you once the final rules and guidelines have been published
Thank you for your time
