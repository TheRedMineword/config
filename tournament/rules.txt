The rules are simple:
1) No cheating or sabotaging the team or acting unfairly towards allies, enemies or organizers
2) Prohibition on killing Cerberus Station (Bob) in DrMineword's star system
3) We expect fair play and a professional approach. We expect you to adhere to the rules of netiquette and prohibit toxicity

The problem with those who cannot follow the rules can and will be solved in the following ways:
Cheating, exploiting etc will end the match/round and the result will be void
Cheating or immoral players will be removed and any rewards will be forfeited.
As a result of breaking the rules of a star system (Don't kill Bob), the team or player WILL PERMANENTLY LOSE access to the star system

Rules are subject to change at any time
Game moderators may impose penalties or other actions at their discretion, as long as they are not immoral or unfair.
Good luck!!
